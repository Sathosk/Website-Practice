Creation of websites for practice

Static Websites created with only css and html for practice. This webpages was made on the begin of my fullstack developer journey, throughout these static webpages that I created I learned in the best way possible core concepts of html and css, watching guides and learning through classes are great, but you really learn once you put yourself out there and try things out on your own!
