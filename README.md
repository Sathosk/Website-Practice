Creation of websites for practice

Static Websites created with only css and html for practice. These webpages were made on the begin of my fullstack developer journey. Throughout these static webpages that I created I learned in the best way possible core concepts of html and css, watching guides and learning through classes are great, but you really learn once you put yourself out there and try things out on your own. 

I had nothing but images of the websites to work with, so everything here was purely made from the knowledge I had during the time. I highly encourage anyone learning to do the same, you learn a bit from following tutorials on youtube, but by creating code on your own is very efficient to consolidate the knowledge!

You can check them out, just don't judge, this was the very beginning of my journey :grin:<br>
